								<h2>IoT Applications for Smart Cities</h2>
								<p>Approximately 70 percent of the world’s population is expected to live in cities by 2050 according to Gartner. This rapid urban growth is already placing a considerable strain on the existing infrastructure, and with more people making the move to urban living, it’s only going to get worse in the coming years.</p>
								<p>To accommodate this new demand on cities, municipalities around the globe are turning to the Internet of Things innovation to enhance their services, reduce costs, and improve communication and interaction. Though the potential is there for IoT to improve nearly every aspect of urban living, there are three IoT applications for smart cities.</p>
								<ul><li>A more efficient water supply: The Internet of Things has the potential to transform the way cities consume water. Smart meters can improve leak detection and data integrity; prevent lost revenue due to inefficiency, and boost productivity by reducing the amount of time spent entering and analyzing data. Also, these meters can be designed to feature customer-facing portals, providing residents with real-time access to information about their consumption and water supply.</li>
								<li>An innovative solution to traffic congestion: As more and more people move to cities, traffic congestion – which is already a massive problem – is only going to get worse. Fortunately, the Internet of Things is well positioned to make improvements in this area that can benefit residents immediately. For example, smart traffic signals can adjust their timing to accommodate commutes and holiday traffic and keep cars moving. City officials can collect and aggregate data from traffic cameras, mobile phones, vehicles, and road sensors to monitor traffic incidents in real-time. Drivers can be alerted of accidents and directed to routes that are less congested. The possibilities are endless and the impact will be substantial.</li>
								<li>Improved public safety: Smart cities and their CSP partners often implement video monitoring systems to tackle the safety concerns that come up in every growing city. Some cities now have hundreds of cameras monitoring traffic for accidents and public streets for safety concerns. Video analytics software helps process the thousands of hours of video footage each camera produces, whittling it down to only important events. Systems using IoT technology turn every camera attached to the system into a sensor, with edge computing and analytics starting right from the source. Artificial intelligence technology like machine learning will then complete the analysis and send video footage to humans who can react quickly to solve problems and keep residents safe.</li></ul>
								<h2>How Vcreate Logics places IoT in Logistics Ecosystems</h2>
								<p>A recent report by Cisco shows that deployment of IoT solutions in supply chain and logistics has grown by three folds in the last few years, and more is expected in the few coming years. The report estimates nearly $2 trillion to have been generated from IoT deployments in the logistics industry. There are two major forces that are driving the companies to embrace the new technology:</p>
									<ul><li>Technology Drive – IoT is made possible by the availability of modern innovations such as smaller and highly efficient hardware, analytics capability for large volumes of data, enhanced communication networks and many more. This makes it simple and affordable to design and implement custom IoT solutions to boost productivity in the business.</li>
									<li>Consumer Demands – Customer experience and satisfaction is a priority for any modern business. Today logistics consumers are looking for transparency, reliability and trust when making purchases. This calls for the industry players to provide tools and services that will build the customer confidence. IoT helps you to establish effective shipment tracking, integrity control and improve efficiency to address your customer needs.</li></ul></p>
									<p>Internet of things can be used in many ways depending on the nature of the business and your overall goals. Here are some of the main applications that VCreate Logics used to take businesses to a whole new level.
									<ul>
									<li>Asset Tracking – Being able to monitor products throughout the supply chain increases security as well as boost the quality of the products. Using modern GPS vehicle tracking and RFID sensors can be used to collect data about the condition, location of the assets, temperature and other forms of data about the specific items. This helps the supply chain managers to implement better quality controls, ensure timely deliveries, minimize theft and have an overall view of the supply chain operation to help in decision making.</li>
									<li>Fleet Management – Modern telematics solutions and GPS positioning sensors can be used to collect real-time data to monitor and analyse vehicle performance and the driver conduct, as well as to track vehicles and the load. From a mobile app, the transportation manager can tell where a specific location, speed and direction is to control drivers from unauthorized activities and bad conduct on and off the road. IoT also gives the manager a clear visibility of the load on transit to prevent tampering and to increase safety.</li></ul></p>
									<p>IoT data can be used to optimise route scheduling and rescheduling, fuel consumption management and reduce emission to increase the company’s green operations scores. Other applications are fault detection to schedule maintenance, increase road safety and to ensure legal compliance.
									<li>Inventory Management and Forecasting – IoT sensors can be used to track inventory and provide data that helps in analyzing trends to predict future inventory needs. This helps to avoid under-stocking and over-stocking situations.</li></ul></p>
									<p>The above are just a few IoT solutions implemented by VCreate Logics that are used to transform supply chain and logistics operations. There is much more than the new technology can do to solve many retailers, consumer and freight companies’ challenges. These opportunities comprise of vehicle to vehicle communication, self-driven vehicles, vehicle tracking in case of theft and worker safety to name just a few. The transformation has already hit the ground, but more is expected in the next 2 to 3 years.</p>
								<h2>Energy and Utilities Ecosystems</h2>
									<p>Decreased cost of intelligent devices and increased computing power and capacity are transforming traditional energy and utilities industries. Companies need to transform their businesses in order to stay competitive and meet new market, regulatory and consumer demands. Best practices are needed to analyze data, monitor processes, conduct secure operations, extend the life of assets and improve productivity and safety.</p>
									<p>For electric utilities, increasing demand for renewable energy solutions, smart grids, distributed energy resources and distributed energy storage systems, among other factors, is transforming the energy & utilities sector, from a centralized generation and delivery model to a dynamic one that requires data analysis, and real-time command decisions. For network operators, the priority is reliable and resilient electric supply and delivery. For market participants, the same priority at the lowest cost.</p>
									<p>For oil, gas and chemical companies, energy resources with low cost of exploration, production and processing are increasingly rare. New IoT technologies and solutions optimize operations through predictive maintenance, remote asset monitoring, track & trace devices, emergency alerts and evacuation systems, and energy efficient facilities.</p>
									<p>Our ‘Energy & Utilities’ Track will approach use cases and success stories of companies that are already applying IoT in their processes. Learn how companies are delivering interoperable, end-to-end IoT solutions to enhance productivity, solve critical problems and improve real-time decision making. See how a deeper level of interoperability, connectivity, and automation through IoT enables energy companies and utilities to be more agile, more flexible and efficient.</p>
